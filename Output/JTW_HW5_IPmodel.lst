      CEE 5410 - Water Resources Systems Analysis
      Dual Formation of a Reservoir optimization problem for HW5
       
      THE PROBLEM:
       
      A FARMER PLANS TO DEVELOP WATER FORIRRIGATION. HE IS CONSIDERING TWO POSSI
      BLE
      SOURCES OF WATER: A GRAVITY DIVERSION FROM A POSSIBLE RESERVOIR WITH TWO
      ALTERNATIVE CPACITIES AND/OR A PUMP FROM A LOWER RIVER DIVERSION (REFER TO
      FIGURE 7.3). BETWEEN THE RESERVOIR AND PUMP SITE THE RIVER BASE FLOW INCRE
      ASES
      BY 2 ACFT/DAY DUE TO GROUNDWATER DRAINAGE INTO THE RIVER. IGNORE LOSSES FR
      OM
      THE RESERVOIR. THE RIVER FLOW INTO THE RESERVOIR AND THE FARMER'S DEMAND D
      URING
      EACH OF THE TWO SIX-MONTH SEASONS OF THE YEAR ARE GIVEN IN TABLE 7.5. REVE
      NUE
      IS ESTIMATED AT $300 PER YEAR PER ACRE IRRIGATED.
       
      SEASONAL FLOW AND DEMAND
       
      SEASON   RIVER INFLOW Qt (acft)  IRRIGATION DEMAND (acft/acre)
      1        600                     1.0
      2        200                     3.0
       
      ASSUME THERE ARE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE SIZES OF RESERVOIR: A HIGH DAM THAT HAS
      CAPACITY OF 700 acft OR A LOW DAM WITH CAPACITY OF 300 acft. THE CAPITATL 
      COSTS
      ARE $10,000/YR AND $6,000/YR FOR THE HIGH AND LOW DAMS, RESPECTIVELY (NO
      OPERATING COST). THE PUMP CAPACITY IS FIXED AT 2.2 acft/day WITH A CAPITAL
       COST
      (IF BUILT) OF $8,000/YR AND OPERATING COST OF $20/acft.
       
      DEVELOP A MIXED INTEGER PROGRAMMING MODEL FOR THIS PROBLEM AND SOLVE.
       
      THE SOLUTION:
      Uses General Algebraic Modeling System to Solve this Linear Program
